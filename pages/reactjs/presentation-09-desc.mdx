### Goal

Built fullstack web using react.

Some design we might try to develop.

### What You need

    1. VS Code or Other Editor
    2. NodeJS
    3. Git Bash Terminal

### Setup

This setup using some reference of [Coding.ID-Code Standardization in Your Next.js Project](https://youtu.be/kvFdYB-ofkE), with some modification.

https://standardjs.com/

### Separate Different Environment

Separate different environment using .env file is common for different stage of development. Common Environment used are:

1. Local: for local development.
2. Alpha-Test: for testing by developer placed in server.
3. Beta-Test: for testing by QA
4. Production: for final user

By default we will have NODE*ENV variabel defined in our environment. We can define custom variabel in .env file using prefix REACT_APP*, also we can have multiple .env file to match defined environment exmp: .env.alpha, .env.production, etc.

example how to define variabel in .env file

```js

REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://baseurl.com

```

example to use defined variabel in our code.

```js
let baseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL;
```

to run or build based on environment we want, we can run command below on terminal or defined an alias in package.json script so we can run it easily

```powershell
//start
env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.alpha react-scripts start

//build
env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.prod npm run-script build
```

```json
"scripts": {
    "start:prod": "env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.prod react-scripts start",
    "build:prod": "env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.prod npm run-script build",
  },
```

### Manage Theming and Styling

### Testing

### Deployment

we can deploy for preview purpose using vercel [here](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/ci-cd/github-actions)
