### Goal

Built fullstack web using react.

Some design we might try to develop.

### Recommended prerequisites:

    1. Basic Programming Skill
    2. Fundamental Javascript
    3. Git Basic [ref](https://docs.yehezgun.com/software-development/git/frequent-used)

### What You need

    1. VS Code or Other Editor
    2. NodeJS
    3. Git Bash Terminal

### Setup for Code Standardization

This setup using some reference of [Coding.ID-Code Standardization in Your Next.js Project](https://youtu.be/kvFdYB-ofkE), with some modification.

why we need this setup:

1. Code style consistency
2. Maintainability and readability
3. Not only code, commit message also should be standardized so it will be readable and understandable [conventional commit summary](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

Famous code Standardization [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/), [airbnb javascript](https://airbnb.io/javascript/), and [airbnb react standard code](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/)

If we want to make our own style guide, we can make manually using tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

Tools we need:

1.  Prettier (Code Formater & VS Code Extention)
2.  ESLint (Linter for JS based project)
3.  Husky (automated linter trigger)
4.  Lint Staged (run linter before commit)
5.  Commit Lint (check commit message before commit)

How to install:

- Prettier

We only need to install plugin Prettier if we use VS Code. or

```powershell
//install
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier

//run
npx prettier --write .
```

then define .prettierrc to add our code formating

```json
{
  "endOfLine": "lf",
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": false,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```

also define .prettierignore, if you like to use npx prettier --write . to ignore some file or folder

```js
# Ignore artifacts:
build
coverage
```

### Separate Different Environment

First we need to install env-cmd to define custom environment variabel.

````powershell
//start
npm install env-cmd

Separate different environment using .env file is common for different stage of development. Common Environment used are:

1. Local: for local development.
2. Alpha-Test: for testing by developer placed in server.
3. Beta-Test: for testing by QA
4. Production: for final user

By default we will have NODE*ENV variabel defined in our environment. We can define custom variabel in .env file using prefix REACT_APP*, also we can have multiple .env file to match defined environment exmp: .env.alpha, .env.production, etc.

example how to define variabel in .env file

```js

REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://baseurl.com

````

example to use defined variabel in our code.

```js
let baseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL;
```

to run or build based on environment we want, we can run command below on terminal or defined an alias in package.json script so we can run it easily

```powershell
//start
env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.alpha react-scripts start

//build
env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.prod npm run-script build
```

```json
"scripts": {
    "start:prod": "env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.prod react-scripts start",
    "build:prod": "env-cmd -f ./environments/.env.prod npm run-script build",
  },
```

### Testing

### Deployment

we can deploy for preview purpose using vercel [here](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/ci-cd/github-actions)
