### Create a New React App

    Use an integrated toolchain for the best user and developer experience.

    The React team primarily recommends these solutions:

    * If you’re learning React or creating a new [single-page](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application) app, use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
        You’ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:
        ```powershell
        npx create-react-app my-app
        cd my-app
        npm start
        ```
    * If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js.
    * If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.
    * If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible Toolchains.
